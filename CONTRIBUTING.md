# Contributing to vrnetlab

Thank you for (considering) contributing to vrnetlab!

## Bugs?
Please report bugs as issues here on GitLab! Also feel free to use issues for asking questions on how to use vrnetlab etc too.

## New feature?
Do you want to build something new? Please open an issue describing your idea so that we can align how it is best implemented. Discussing before you start coding significantly increases the chance that your code will be merged smoothly and without lots of refactoring etc.

If you don't want to code but have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue.

## Code submission
Submit your code as a Pull Request (PR). Make sure it applies cleanly to the master branch!
